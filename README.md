Sample app that demonstrates the functionality of the Fencing Agent for Cordova. 

It's not prebuilt; you'll need to run `cordova build`, and at that point, you should be able to `cordova run` to run the app.

The location of the code that uses the FA is `www/js/index.js`.

When you hit the "switch" button, it'll take you to another screen where you can enter GeoDomains, and when you're inside of a GeoDomain's Fences, its color (or white if it has no color) will display on the LED screen once per second. If you do not know of a GeoDomain to use, then please contact GeoNetwork for the immediate future.
